The machine learning algorithm: An Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall. For this application the SVM performs these operations on our data that will be used for the prediction.

The model used: C-Support Vector Classification in the Support Vector Machines scikit-learn library
